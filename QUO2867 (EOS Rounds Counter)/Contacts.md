Hi Adrian,

I am working with Wesley on your quote for PCA Rounds Counter. We have a few questions below.

1. Cradle Electronics Heatsink - 1001792 - We have no drawing etc for this. Could you provide a drawing or advise whether you will provide this to us.
2. Common Mode Choke - WCA05814 - We have no detail here other than your internal part number. Could you provide details or advise if you will provide this to us.

Kind Regards
