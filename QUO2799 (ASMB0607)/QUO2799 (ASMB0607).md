# TODO
- [x] Get Mike to restructure Wabtec document in product specific processes https://midgard/cms/pages/pages.cgi?page=44:334:919:336:87:552:1581
- [x] Do process flow diagram
- [ ] Low level bom
	- [ ] https://midgard/cms/newdb/listing.cgi?form=tritium_boms&where=tritium_client=%22Wabtec%22%20AND%20tritium_bom_code=%22QUO2799_ASMB0607_Downhole%22
- [ ] High level bom (packaging and box) (ID: 38811)
	- [x] Find custom ESD bag (board is 406.4mm x 35mm) 16" x 2"
		- https://www.digikey.com.au/en/products/detail/scs/100426/3305939?gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22258692864&gbraid=0AAAAADrbLlg2tPXYXs2A70rFrxJuXBvSu&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw_Hmt7GljwMVlFwPAh3jowgZEAQYAiABEgJTEPD_BwE
	- [x] Find custom box potential (ID: 46740)
	- [ ] https://midgard/cms/newdb/listing.cgi?form=tritium_boms&where=tritium_client=%22Wabtec%22%20AND%20tritium_bom_code=%22QUO2799_ASMB0607_Downhole_PackagingKit%22
- [ ] Panelise min 100mm width (5x1?)
- [x] Reserve "nice" id (ending with zeros) for end product (ID: 38810)
- [ ] Organise mech team to draw me a diagram and release for thermal pad
	- [ ] Chatted with Meghan
	- [ ] Allocate job code & get her to issue ID with released document
- [ ] Wes Questions
	- [x] Where does thermal pad live? HL/LL? (Low level BOM)
	- [ ] What to do with bare board? 5x1 panel do I make 1/5th
	- [ ] Rework kit?
		- [ ] U3 TLV803EA29VDBZR and R1 0R Resistor not in normal BOM
- [ ] Email to Wabtec once PO approved
	- [ ] Update on supply of TF1 TF2 (FIA Supplied)
	- [ ] Check that photos of Digireels/Bags are suffice for Intrinsic Safety Requirements as QTY won't be high enough for full reels.
	- [ ] Request confirmation that testing will work without battery?

# NOTES
- Extra conformal coating step in assembly instructions (aerosol + manual brush)
- ISO610 compliance on MELF rework steps? Seems fine as Class 1,2,3
