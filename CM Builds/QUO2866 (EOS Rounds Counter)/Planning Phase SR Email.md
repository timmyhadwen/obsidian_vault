Hi Kara,

Thanks for the order for the 10x Rounds Counter M249 2010619 PCAs. I'll be managing the delivery of this project.

A few things we'll need to move on fairly quickly in order to meet the tight timelines. Mainly related to the EOS supplied parts.
1. AD22286-R2 EOS to supply 10 units to IntelliDesign
2. PIC Microcontroller 1001745, IntelliDesign to issue 10 units to EOS, to be issued back to IntelliDesign once programmed.

I helped Frank with the initial lead time review and didn’t identify any blockers to delivering the first 7 units within 6 weeks. Consequently I have set our dispatch date for PO45030493 as October 7. I understand EOS will be supplying a revision to that PO to remove the NRE charge.

As this is a significant revision there is some risk that there will be errors in either the PCB design files, introduced through our translation of the files or by the PCB manufacturer. Consequently, I suggest that it’s prudent for us to wait on ordering the PCBs for PO45030495 until the first 7 units have been verified. The PCBs have a 3 week lead time. Subsequently I suggest the following timeline for delivery of the serial production order:

- FAI units dispatched October 7
- EOS provides feedback and Intelli responds October 17.
- PCBs purchased and received: November 11.
- IntelliDesign manufactures 90 PCAs. Three weeks. Dispatch December 2.

For the first 7 units I understand these will be critically inspected by EOS but a formal AS9102 FAI submission from IntelliDesign is out of scope for this order.

Finally, I have a memory that you also wanted 50 bare PCBs. Is this still the case?

If any of the above needs some shuffling to meet the requirements on your end please don’t hesitate to give me a call.

Kind regards,
Tim Hadwen
