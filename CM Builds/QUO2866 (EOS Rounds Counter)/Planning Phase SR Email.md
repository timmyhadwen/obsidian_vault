Hi Kara,

Thanks for the order for the 10x Rounds Counter M249 2010619 PCAs. I'll be managing the delivery of this project.

A few things we'll need to move on fairly quickly in order to meet the tight timelines. Mainly related to the EOS supplied parts.
1. AD22286-R2 EOS to supply 10 units to IntelliDesign
2. PIC Microcontroller 1001745, IntelliDesign to issue 10 units to EOS, to be issued back to IntelliDesign once programmed.

As discussed in the quoting phase with Frank, we've set the dispatch date to the 17th October 2025.

Project Timeline
- PCBs purchased and received by Wed 8th October including EOS supplied parts.
- IntelliDesignÂ manufactures 10 PCAs. 1 week. Dispatch 17th October


Kind regards,
Tim Hadwen
