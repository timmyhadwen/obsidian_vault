Hi Adrian,

I am working with Wesley on your quote for PCA Rounds Counter (2010619-01). We have a few questions below.

1. Cradle Electronics Heatsink - 1001792 - We have no drawing etc for this. Could you provide a drawing or advise whether you will provide this to us.
2. Common Mode Choke - WCA05814 - We have no detail here other than your internal part number. Could you provide details or advise if you will provide this to us.
3. MMA6825BKCW is end of life and not available from authorised suppliers. Is EOS able to supply this part? Alternatively we could look into broker supply.

Kind Regards
