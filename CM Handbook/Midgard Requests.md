## Costing Sheets
1. Price reviews don't order by time created when multiple are created within a day. Would be great to show time created on these.
2. Would be nice to be able to delete price reviews (or at least mark them as bad) to reduce risk of reading off the wrong one during quoting.
3. When running off a Tritium BOM it is difficult/not practical to reimport from the BOM
	1. At the moment we add &rebuild=1 to the url and then lose all our notes/comments/RFQs etc
	2. Could we make the diff tool that works with EBOMs work with Tritum BOMs?
4. Could we have a button to add a line to the Costing Sheet?
	1. This can be useful when extra parts are found in project documentation that aren't in the BOM or if there is a weird labour amount that needs to be included but doesn't relate to a specific part
5. Could we clear octopart queries or at least their results for parts which are not octopart but have an MPN that matches something else on octopart?
## Task Boards
1. Select all lines button (useful when doing scheduling for CM projects etc)
	1. Sequence all projects button would be equally as useful
