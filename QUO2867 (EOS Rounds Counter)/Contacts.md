Hi Adrian,

I am working with Wesley on your quotes. We have a few questions below.

For 2004264-03 Cradle Electronics MK44:
1. Cradle Electronics Heatsink - 1001792 - We have no drawing etc for this. Could you provide a drawing or advise whether you will provide this to us.
2. Common Mode Choke - WCA05814 - We have no detail here other than your internal part number. Could you provide details or advise if you will provide this to us.
3. MMA6825BKCW is end of life and not available from authorised suppliers. Is EOS able to supply this part? Alternatively we could look into broker supply.
4. QSMO-4250F-30MHz is available from the manufacturer with a 5 week lead time. This is driving the production lead time. Can you advise if an alternate part or if you have stock of these parts?

For 2010619-01 Rounds Counter M249:
1. AD22286-R2 is end of life and not available from authorised suppliers. Is EOS able to supply this part? Alternatively we could look into broker supply.

Kind Regards
