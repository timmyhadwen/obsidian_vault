- [x] Wes Questions
	- [x] Where does thermal pad live? HL/LL? (Low level BOM)
	- [x] What to do with bare board? 5x1 panel do I make 1/5th
	- [x] Rework kit?
		- [x] U3 TLV803EA29VDBZR and R1 0R Resistor not in normal BOM
		- [x] Tom S said do a rework kit and document
	- [x] Second conformal coat step MG Chemicals 422C not in BOM
		- [x] https://mektronics.com.au/products/mg-chemicals-422c-silicone-conformal-coating-55ml
- [ ] TRT for assembly
	- [/] SMT
	- [/] THA & Thermal Pad
	- [ ] Testing
	- [ ] Conformal Coat
	- [ ] Packaging
- [ ] Email to Wabtec once PO approved
	- [ ] Update on supply of TF1 TF2 (FIA Supplied)
	- [ ] Check that photos of Digireels/Bags are suffice for Intrinsic Safety Requirements as QTY won't be high enough for full reels.
	- [ ] Request confirmation that testing will work without battery?
# Notes
- Extra conformal coating step in assembly instructions (aerosol + manual brush)
- ISO610 compliance on MELF rework steps? Seems fine as Class 3

1. Surface Mount Assembly
2. SMD Mods (must be done before thermal pad application)
	1. MELF solder addition
	2. Bodge R34 with SOT-23 part
	3. Bodge 0R on SOT-23 footprint
3. Thermal pad application
4. Through hole assembly
	1. Thermal fuses (with bending jig?)
