Hi Kara,

Thanks for the order for the 70x Cradle Electronics PCAs. I'll be managing the delivery of this project.

As noted in the quote the initial delivery of 5 units is contingent on us receiving sample quantities of the 3x Amphenol Positronic connectors.

Additionally we'll require the following parts from EOS:
1. IRL2505PBF - EOS to supply
2. MMA6825BKCW - EOS to supply
3. WCA05814 Common mode choke - we require an alternate part number for the ferrite core.
4. Mosfet bending Jig - EOS to supply
5. Test kit (including PC if software does not run on windows 11)
6. Golden sample unit for validating test setup

With the above requirements in mind, we have set the delivery date of the first 5 units as 4th December.

Project Timeline
- PCBs purchased and received by 10th November including EOS supplied parts.
- IntelliDesignÂ manufactures 5 Assemblies. 3 week. Dispatch 4th December

Kind regards,
Tim Hadwen
